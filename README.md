In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!
We will be exploring data from 2 data sets - colors and sets. From the colors dataset we will want to explore the distribution of transparent vs. non-transparent colors.
Another interesting dataset available in this database is the sets data. It contains a comprehensive list of sets over the years and the number of parts that each of these sets contained.
